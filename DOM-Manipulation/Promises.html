    <p>Synchronous VS Asynchronous task in JS</p>
    <h2>Synchronous Task</h2>
    <p>Task that are executed line by line and finally gives result, for example adding 2 numbers</p>

    <h2>Asynchronous Task</h2>
    <p>Task that may take time to execute. Asynchronous task always return Promises. In case of Asynchronous task the
        execution does not waits for the result and moves forward to next line. To make execution wait "await" keyword
        is used in async functions.</p>
        <p>Asynchronous functions:
            Functions that take some time to complete, such as reading a file or making a network request, often return promises. This allows the caller to wait for the function to finish before proceeding.</p>
    <h2>About Promises in JS</h2>
    <p>A JavaScript Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous
        operation. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous code in a more manageable and readable way.
        Promises can be in one of three states:
    <pre>
        Pending: The promise is still waiting for the asynchronous operation  to complete.
        Fulfilled: The asynchronous operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.
        Rejected: The asynchronous operation failed, and the promise has an error
    </pre>

    </p>
