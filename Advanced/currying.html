    <h2>Currying in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>It is a technique in functional programming, that transforms the function of multiple arguments into several functions of a single argument in sequence. </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> An American mathematician named Haskell Curry developed this technique, thatâ€™s why it is called currying.</p>

    <h3>Why is currying useful in JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It helps us to create a higher-order function</li>
        <li>It reduces the chances of error in our function by dividing it into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility.</li>
        <li>It is very useful in building modular and reusable code</li>
        <li>It helps us to avoid passing the same variable multiple times</li>
        <li>It makes the code more readable</li>
    </ul>
