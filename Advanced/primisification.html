    <h1>Promisification in JS</h1>
    <p>The process of converting a simple callback function to a function returning promise is call Promisification.</p>
    <P>In earlier JavaScript concept of Promise was not there so people used callbacks, and using callbacks can lead to a well known
        "callback hell" problem. To resolve this callback hell issue Promises came in picture in JavaScript.
    </P>
